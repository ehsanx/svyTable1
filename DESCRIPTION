Description: A tool to create publication-ready tables from complex 
    survey data, including descriptive summaries and multi-panel 
    interaction reports. It also provides a suite of functions to 
    evaluate survey-weighted regression models and survey-weighted 
    survival plots, including coefficient diagnostics, 
    goodness-of-fit tests, design-correct AUC calculations,
    proportional hazards assumption testing, and visualization 
    of interaction effects.
